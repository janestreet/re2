;; This library only packages the upstream libre2 library. We put in a
;; separate library rather than putting in re2 directly to avoid
;; having to merge the .a and .so for libre2 and for the stubs of re2,
;; which is hard to do in a portable way

;; We overapproximate the dependency of running make by depending on everything
;; in libre2 except for [obj] so we don't retrigger itself (obj contains build targets).
;; [obj] is excluded from dependencies by listing it in jbuild-ignore, sadly not the most
;; direct mechanism. The same mechanism also makes sure jenga doesn't delete the contents
;; of [obj] by stale artifacts removal.
;; 'make' doesn't rebuild in case of variable update (CXX, CXXFLAGS) so
;; we call 'make clean' first.
