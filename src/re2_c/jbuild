;; This library only packages the upstream libre2 library. We put in a
;; separate library rather than putting in re2 directly to avoid
;; having to merge the .a and .so for libre2 and for the stubs of re2,
;; which is hard to do in a portable way

;; We overapproximate the dependency of running make by depending on everything
;; in libre2. It doesn't seem to cause any issue that files in libre2/obj are actually
;; targets.  And even in theory, we should re-run make at most twice per change: once
;; when the source files change, and again when that changes the obj files.
;; 'make' doesn't rebuild in case of variable update (CXX, CXXFLAGS) so
;; we call 'make clean' first.
